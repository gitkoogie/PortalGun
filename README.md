# PortalGun
Me and my friend built a Rick and Morty portal gun on a few days notice prior to 2022 years halloween party.

Requirements:
* Rotary encoder shall increase / decrease number on 7 segment display.
* Pushing down rotary encoder shall turn on / off front panel LED's
* LED on top is always on

Components "Required" :
* Aruino Uno (Very very overkill but what we had available atm)
* 2 x 74HC595 shift registers (SIPO)
* 1 x 7 Segment with 4 segments
* 8 x 220 resistors (for LED's)
* 4 x Green LED
* 3D printer (black and white PLA)
* Glue gun
* 3 x 10 mm screws

Future improvements (when time is available):
* Design PCB with above functionalities
* Add functionality for generating sound when pushing rotary encoder
* Create some type of "lava / squid / motion" aspect of top LED
* Make device chargeable with usb-c
* Implement sleep functionality for saving power when devce is not used
